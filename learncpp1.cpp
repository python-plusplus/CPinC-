//Hi Sunny, the date is April 7th, 2020 and you are starting to your journey to
//learning C++! From now, you will temporarily forget about python and learn c++
//exclusively! Good luck! 
//What you have learned today:
//Some gVim stuff including: spliting windows, going to lines and searching and
//repeating through them with 'n' and also how to compile using g++ and running
//them.
//You also learned a bit about running and compiling straight from the gVim editor!
//!<terminal command to run it>
//:cd to move dir, :w ~/Desktop/CP/gang.cpp to save file, :e to open them
//Also remember :help, :set, and <Line Number>G.
//
//Alright now let's write your first program (Not Really) 
//
//So we just figured out how to map so we will map our save & compile & permissions all to one command which will be <F2>
//Our mapping command will be map
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	string input;
	string poopy;
	int i;
	cin >> input >> poopy;
	cout << "xi" << poopy << " " << input << endl;	
	for(i=0;i<100;i++){
		cout << input << "\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
